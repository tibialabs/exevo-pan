## Char Bazaar Data

Since there is no official API from Cipsoft, all the data used in this app is scraped from the official [Tibia](https://www.tibia.com/) website. You can check the scraping scripts [here](https://github.com/xandjiji/tibia-bazaar-scraper).

All live data is fetched from these endpoints:

`https://exevopan-data.netlify.app/LatestCharacterData.json`

`https://exevopan-data.netlify.app/ItemsData.json`

`https://exevopan-data.netlify.app/ServerData.json`

They are being updated around every 5 minutes

This project was done using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).
